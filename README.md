# About the Project
The Women's Issues Network of Belize aims to develop **EmpowerNet**, a robust knowledge base system that centralizes data related to violence against women and other critical information on the status of women from multiple sources. This system will allow employees to input data from various sources regarding violence against women, health issues, and employment. Additinally, it will facilitate the generation of reports and enable seamless searching and retrieval of critical information to enhance decision-making and advocacy efforts for women's empowerment.
